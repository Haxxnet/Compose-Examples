## ‚ú® Requirements
- Docker Compose

## üéì Usage
- Volume bind mounts are assumed to be located at `/mnt/docker-volumes/<container-name>/`
- Volume permissions (UID:GUID) must be set correctly by yourself. Usually `1000:1000` - otherwise read the notes!
- Docker networks are not pre-defined. Adjust to your preference and network/proxy setup.
- Example config files are usually provided but not yet located in the correct volume bind mount paths. Adjust!
- Example credentials should be always adjusted due to security reasons. Read the comments!

Otherwise, it should be a matter of:
````
git clone https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples && cd Compose-Examples
cd <container-of-interest>

# read the notes, comments and adjust compose + volumes + configs
docker compose up
````
