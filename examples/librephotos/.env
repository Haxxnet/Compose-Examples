# This file contains all the things you need to change to set up your Libre Photos. 
# There are a few items that must be set for it to work such as the location of your photos.
# After the mandatory entries there are some optional ones that you may set. 

# Start of mandatory changes. 

# Location of your photos.
scanDirectory=/mnt/docker-volumes/librephotos/pictures

# Internal data of LibrePhotos

# Wow, we are at the optional now. Pretty easy so far. You do not have to change any of the below. 

#What port should Libre Photos be accessed at (Default 3000)
httpPort=3000

# What branch should we install the latest weekly build or the development branch (dev)
tag=latest

# Number of workers, which take care of the request to the api. This setting can dramatically affect the ram usage.
# A positive integer generally in the 2-4 x $(NUM_CORES) range.
# You’ll want to vary this a bit to find the best for your particular workload.
# Each worker needs 800MB of RAM. Change at your own will. Default is 2.
gunniWorkers=2

# You can set the database name. Did you know Libre Photos was forked from OwnPhotos?
dbName=librephotos

# Here you can change the user name for the database.
dbUser=docker

# The password used by the database.
dbPass=AaAa1234

# Default minimum rating to interpret as favorited. This default value is used when creating a new user.
# Users can change this in their settings (Dashboards > Library).
DEFAULT_FAVORITE_MIN_RATING=4

# Database host. Only change this if you want to use your own existing Postgres server. If using your own server, you can remove the 'db' container from docker-compose.yml. If you're changing the name of the DB's container name (DB_CONT_NAME further down), you need to set this variable to match that name too.
dbHost=db

# Set the names of the docker containers to your own entries. Or don't, I'm not your dad.
# Changing these will require you to `make rename` to rename the services, and start the system with your chosen `docker-compose up -d` invocation again.
# Note that changing the DB_CONT_NAME will also need you to set the `dbHost` variable to the same value.
DB_CONT_NAME=db
BACKEND_CONT_NAME=backend
FRONTEND_CONT_NAME=frontend
PROXY_CONT_NAME=proxy
REDIS_CONT_NAME=redis

# If you are not a developer ignore the following parameters: you will never need them.

# Where shall we store the backend and frontend code files.

# Location for pgAdmin
