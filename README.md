## ‚ú® Requirements
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## üéì Usage
- Volume bind mounts are assumed to be located at `/mnt/docker-volumes/<container-name>/`. You can adjust the path via the global env variable `DOCKER_VOLUME_STORAGE` to your liking though. The compose examples will fall back to `/mnt/docker-volumes/<container-name>/` if the env variable is not set on your Docker server.
- Volume permissions (UID:GUID) must be set correctly by yourself. Usually `1000:1000` - otherwise read the notes!
- Docker networks are not pre-defined. Adjust to your preference and network/proxy setup.
- Example config files are usually provided but not yet located in the correct volume bind mount paths. Adjust!
- Example credentials should always be adjusted due to security reasons. May put them in a separate `.env` file or platform for secrets management.

Otherwise, it should be a matter of:
````
git clone https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples && cd Compose-Examples
cd <container-of-interest>

# read the notes, comments and adjust compose + volumes + configs
docker compose up
````
> [!TIP]  
> You can find an online web version of this GitHub repository [here](https://haxxnet.github.io/Compose-Examples/).

> [!CAUTION]
> The samples are intended for local development environments such as project setups, tinkering with software stacks, etc. These samples may be deployed in production environments or exposed to the Internet but please adhere to general hardening and security guidelines. Adjust all default credentials, use a separate `.env` file or platform for secret management, implement a backup process and have a tested disaster recovery plan. Use a reverse proxy to stream-line your web service exposure and provide an encrypted HTTPS communication channel with trusted SSL certificates.
